# gsa-chatmonitor

This is a basic copy of what ChatMonitor used to be on GameSpy Arcade to the best of my (Falcon) memory as someone on the OpenSpy team that was a previous GameSpy Arcade Admin/Wizard/Helper.

Some functions are commented out but can easily be enabled. There will be a few things that need altering like the profile id, username, password, oper email, etc.

Review the commented lines and script itself for anything you might need to change.
